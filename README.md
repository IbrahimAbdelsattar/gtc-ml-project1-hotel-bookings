# Hotel Booking Demand Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to identify patterns, trends, and key factors influencing booking demand. By applying **data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering techniques**, the dataset was prepared for further modeling and predictive analysis. The ultimate goal is to provide insights into customer behavior and improve hotel management strategies, such as reducing cancellations, improving guest satisfaction, and enhancing revenue management.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description  
The dataset contains booking records from two types of hotels: **Resort Hotel** and **City Hotel**.  
Each row represents a booking with details about the booking process, guest information, and stay details.  

### Key Columns  
- **hotel**: Type of hotel (Resort or City).  
- **is_canceled**: Whether the booking was canceled (1) or not (0).  
- **lead_time**: Number of days between booking and arrival.  
- **arrival_date_year**, **arrival_date_month**, **arrival_date_week_number**, **arrival_date_day_of_month**: Information about the arrival date.  
- **stays_in_weekend_nights**, **stays_in_week_nights**: Number of weekend/weekday nights booked.  
- **adults**, **children**, **babies**: Number of guests.  
- **meal**: Type of meal booked.  
- **country**: Country of origin of the guest.  
- **market_segment**: Market segment of the booking (e.g., Online TA, Corporate).  
- **distribution_channel**: How the booking was made.  
- **is_repeated_guest**: Whether the guest is a returning guest.  
- **previous_cancellations**, **previous_bookings_not_canceled**: Guestâ€™s booking history.  
- **reserved_room_type**, **assigned_room_type**: Room reserved vs. room assigned.  
- **booking_changes**: Number of changes made to the booking.  
- **deposit_type**: Type of deposit required.  
- **agent**, **company**: IDs of travel agent and company.  
- **days_in_waiting_list**: Number of days the booking was on the waiting list.  
- **customer_type**: Type of booking (Transient, Group, etc.).  
- **adr**: *Average Daily Rate*, calculated as revenue generated by the booking divided by the number of nights.  
- **required_car_parking_spaces**, **total_of_special_requests**: Extra requests from the guest.  
- **reservation_status**, **reservation_status_date**: Final status and date of the booking.

## ðŸ›  Steps Performed

### 1. Handling Missing Values  
- **Children column**: Missing values were imputed with `0`, assuming no children when data is missing.  
- **Country column**: Missing values were filled with the most frequent country (mode).  
- **Agent & Company columns**: Missing values were replaced with `0`, representing "no agent" or "no company."  

âœ… After handling missing values, the dataset had no null values.

---

### 2. Outlier Detection & Treatment  
- **Boxplots** were used to visualize numerical features such as `adr`, `lead_time`, `stays_in_weekend_nights`, `stays_in_week_nights`, and `days_in_waiting_list`.  
- **IQR (Interquartile Range)** method was applied to detect outliers.  
- Outliers were particularly noticeable in the **ADR (Average Daily Rate)** and **Lead Time** columns.  
- Outliers were handled carefully since extreme values can heavily affect model performance.

---

### 3. Data Type Correction  
Using `df.info()`, we identified and corrected data types:  
- **`children`, `agent`, and `company`** were converted to integers.  
- **Categorical columns** (`hotel`, `meal`, `country`, `market_segment`, `distribution_channel`, `reserved_room_type`, `assigned_room_type`, `deposit_type`, `customer_type`, `reservation_status`) were converted to the `category` type to optimize memory usage and improve processing speed.  
- **Dates**: `reservation_status_date` was converted to `datetime` format.  

âœ… This ensured all columns had the correct and efficient data types for analysis.

---

### 4. Feature Engineering  
To enhance the dataset and provide new insights:  
- **room_changed**: Binary feature (1 if reserved room type â‰  assigned room type, else 0). This helps identify possible overbooking or upgrades.  
- **waiting_list_flag**: Binary feature (1 if `days_in_waiting_list` > 0, else 0). This indicates bookings that were initially on a waiting list.  
- **total_stays**: Total nights of stay (`stays_in_weekend_nights` + `stays_in_week_nights`).  
- **total_guests**: Sum of adults, children, and babies.  
- **arrival_date**: A new datetime feature combining year, month, and day for easier time-based analysis.  

âœ… These engineered features provide deeper insights into guest behavior and hotel operations.

## ðŸš€ Importance of the Project  
- **Business Value**: Helps hotels optimize booking strategies, reduce cancellations, and better manage resources.  
- **Customer Insights**: Identifies guest behavior, preferences, and factors influencing booking/cancellation decisions.  
- **Revenue Optimization**: By understanding patterns in ADR, booking lead times, and cancellations, hotels can adjust pricing and policies effectively.  
- **Operational Improvements**: Detects mismatches in room assignments, repeated guest behaviors, and the impact of waiting lists on cancellations.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Next Steps  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover deeper insights.  
- Build **predictive models** to forecast cancellations and optimize booking demand.  
- Apply **classification algorithms** to predict `is_canceled`.  
- Deploy results in a **dashboard/visualization tool** for business stakeholders.

## âœ… Summary of Progress So Far  
1. Loaded and understood the dataset.  
2. Handled missing values.  
3. Detected and treated outliers.  
4. Corrected data types.  
5. Engineered new features to enrich the dataset.  

This structured data is now ready for **EDA and modeling**.
